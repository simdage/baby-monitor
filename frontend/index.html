    <!-- Add Tailwind via CDN for simplicity in this setup, or we can set up postcss. 
         Since the plan didn't explicitly mention full Tailwind setup, CDN is safer for a single-file convert.
         However, the user's code uses tailwind classes heavily. 
         Let's try to add the actual tailwind config if possible, but for now CDN is a quick win to make sure it looks right immediately. 
         Actually, let's just stick to the plan. I included tailwind in package.json devDeps. 
         I should also create postcss.config.js and tailwind.config.js if I want it to build properly. 
         Or just add the CDN link as a fallback. 
         Let's stick to standard build. Accessing via CDN is strictly discouraged for production apps but this is a containerized app so local build is better.
         I will create tailwind.config.js next.
